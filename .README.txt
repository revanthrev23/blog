1) I am using the https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts API to get posts data . It contains 100 blogs with various fields like userId, id(postsId), title and body.
2) This project is completely built using ReactJS. 
3) localhost:3000 is the url which shows or lists all the posts. (LIST ALL POSTS)
4) localhost:3000/post/${id} opens the post corresponding to the 'id' value.
5) localhost:3000/edit/${id} edits the post corresponding to the 'id' value.
6) Delete does not have any url as it is taken care in a modal.
7) localhost:3000/create is used to create a new blog post.

This is how the CRUD operation is implemented in the server.

Instead of navigating using url, the users can even navigate using the buttons present in the UI to achieve the same functionalities listed above. 

8) Sorting functionality with respect to id is added.
